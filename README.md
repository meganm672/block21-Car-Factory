# block21-Car-Factory

## Overview

The automotive industry comprises a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, and selling of motor vehicles.</br>

There is a world of choice in today's car market, what with more than 400 different models available.</br>

In this workshop, you will be tasked with coding a virtual assembly line to create some different types of vehicles with as many as the same parts as you possibly can.</br>

## Project Requirements

*Create file index.js to work in.</br>

*Write code that defines a constructor function called Car that creates a new object with the following properties: make, model, and year.</br>

*Add a method called getDescription to the Car prototype, which returns a string containing information about the car.</br>

*Define the ElectricCar function as a subclass of Car. Include an additional property called range that represents the range of the electric car in miles.</br>

*Have the ElectricCar prototype override the getDescription method of the Car prototype with a new implementation that includes information about the range of the electric car.</br>

*Create an instance of ElectricCar with the make "Tesla", model "Model S", year 2019, and range 300, and the getDescription method is called on the instance. The output will be a string containing the make, model, year, and range of the electric car.</br>
